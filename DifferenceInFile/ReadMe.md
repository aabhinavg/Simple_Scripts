# Custom Diff Output Script

## Overview

This Python script is designed to extract and group lines from the output of the `diff` command in Linux. The grouping is based on custom prefixes that you can specify. The script takes a text file containing the output of the `diff` command and a list of custom prefixes as input, and it generates an output file that groups and formats the lines accordingly.

## Dependencies

Before using this script, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed on your Linux system:

- Python 3.x
- The `diff` command (a standard Linux utility)

## Usage

1. Make sure you have the required dependencies installed.

2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

4. Run the script using the following command:

   ```bash
   python3 custom_diff_output.py input_file output_file --custom-prefixes "prefix1,prefix2"

## Detailed Explanation

The script operates as follows:

1. **Opening the Input File**: The script begins by opening the input file for reading. It reads the content of the input file using the `with open(input_file, "r") as f` context manager.

2. **Regular Expression Matching**: The script employs regular expressions to search for lines that start with custom prefixes provided as command-line arguments. It uses the `re.findall()` method to find lines that match the specified prefixes.

3. **Combining Lines**: The script then combines the lists of lines that match the custom prefixes to create a single list of grouped lines. This combined list is used for further processing.

4. **Creating a Dictionary**: The script creates a dictionary to store prefixes and lists of corresponding file names. It iterates through the grouped lines, splitting each line using the colon (":") as the separator. The part before the colon is considered the prefix, and the part after the colon is considered the file name.

5. **Prefix and Suffix Mapping**: For each line, the script checks if the prefix is already in the dictionary. If the prefix exists, it appends the file name to the list of suffixes under that prefix. If the prefix is new, it creates a list with the first file name.

6. **Writing to the Output File**: The script opens the output file for writing and proceeds to write the grouped and formatted lines to the output file. If there are multiple suffixes for a given prefix, it prints the prefix in blue color and the file names in green color. If there is only one suffix, it prints the prefix and the single suffix in the respective colors.

7. **Completion Message**: After processing all the lines and writing to the output file, the script informs the user about the number of grouped lines that were extracted and written to the output file.

## Important Note

The script's output is dependent on the formatting and structure of the `diff` command output. Any changes in the `diff` command's output format may affect the script's behavior.

Please ensure that the `diff` command output provided as input matches the expected format for the script to work correctly.
